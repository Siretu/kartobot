# kartobot

### Introduction
This project was created by @Siretu, @setfal and @exuvo as a project course. We built and programmed a navigation robot pretty much from scratch. The robot (called kartobot) is equipped with a tower of two rotating ultrasonic sensors. These rotate continuously to provide the robot with sensor input about its surroundings. This data is then sent to the computer wirelessly using the xbee chip. The navigation data is drawn as a map on the computer and it's also used locally on the robot to avoid obstacles. The robot uses a dynamic A* pathfinding to automatically explore more of the surrounding areas.
